                            John Doe, DDS
                            I am a graduate of the University of London, Faculty of Dentistry. During my studies, I was an active member of the British Dental Association and participated in scientific research at the Department of General Dentistry. In 2017-2018, I completed an internship at a renowned Dental Clinic in Manchester.     
                            In 2019, I began my specialization in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Royal Dental Institute in London, and I am currently continuing my training at St. Thomasâ€™ Hospital in the Department of Oral Surgery.    
                            For several years, I have worked as a lecturer, teaching dental assisting and hygiene programs.    
                            I have participated in numerous courses and training sessions in oral surgery, restorative dentistry, and prosthodontics, constantly improving my skills to provide the highest level of care.
